Founded in August 2022, our journey began with the release of Ask, our answer engine, in December 2022. Since then, we've experienced rapid growth, reaching 2 million monthly active users in just four months.

We envision Perplexity AI as a platform beyond a traditional search engine, evolving into a comprehensive knowledge hub where anyone can explore and learn effortlessly. In pursuit of this vision, we are committed to providing citations with every answer, providing proper attribution for sources of information and allowing for verification.\n\nAs part of our mission, we are excited to expand our platform from web to mobile, with almost half of our users already accessing us via mobile web. To improve our mobile experience, today we are launching the Perplexity AI iPhone app. With instant answers, cited sources, voice search, follow-up questions, and thread history, our app delivers a comprehensive interface for information.\n\nAs a team, we are honored to have the support of our users and investors as we pursue our mission of redefining the way people search for and access information. Thank you for joining us on this journey, and we look forward to continuing to push the limits of language models and search. The frontier of interactive possibilities is just beginning to be explored.\n\nDownload our iPhone app today at [perplexity.ai/download-iphone](https://www.perplexity.ai/download-iphone).\n\nOur team is small but growing: see [perplexity.ai/careers](https://www.perplexity.ai/careers) for the latest job opportunities at Perplexity.\n\nFollow our Twitter at [twitter.com/perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai) for new releases.\n\nJoin our Discord community at [discord.gg/perplexity-ai](https://discord.gg/perplexity-ai).\n\n",date:"March 28, 2023"})})]})})})]})},p=e=>{let{}=e;return(0,n.jsx)(n.Fragment,{children:(0,n.jsx)(c,{})})};var m=p}},function(e){e.O(0,[3182,9618,9774,2888,179],function(){return e(e.s=23986)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
